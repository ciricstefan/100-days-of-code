### Day 1: May 27, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through Basic HTML,HTML5 & CSS sections on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Already tried finishing freeCodeCamp curriculum a long time ago but never had enough time for it. Now with 100daysofcode I plan on finishing it, getting certifications I am interested in and building projects for my portfolio website.
